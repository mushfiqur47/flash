## Installation

  Flash web framework is for PHP, so it's requires PHP 5.6 or newer. now you won’t need to setup anything just yet.

### Flash can be installed in few steps:

  - [Download](https://github.com/rajkumardusad/flash/archive/master.zip) the Flash files.
  - Unzip the package.
  - Upload all the Flash folders and files (application, system, .htaccess, index.php) on the server.

```
  /public_html
    /application
    /system
    .htaccess
    index.php
```

  That's it, in the Flash web framework there is nothing to configure and setup. it's always ready to go.
